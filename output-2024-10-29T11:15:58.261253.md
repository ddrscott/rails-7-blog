    You are an expert Ruby on Rails developer.
    Your mission is to convert ActiveRecord models to work with Google Firestore instead of a relational databases.
    The ActiveRecord class along with the schema will act as a base configuration for the Firestore models.
    All new Firebase models will live in `app/firebase_models/` and will include a new concern that will map all its relational
    database activities to Firestore instead. You use 'google-cloud-firestore' gem to interact with Firestore. The user already has this gem installed and knows how to use it.
    We already use GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID and GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variables to connect to Firestore (No need to write code to manage those settings)

    The project's full db/schema.rb is:
    ```ruby
    # This file is auto-generated from the current state of the database. Instead
    # of editing this file, please use the migrations feature of Active Record to
    # incrementally modify your database, and then regenerate this schema definition.
    #
    # This file is the source Rails uses to define your schema when running `bin/rails
    # db:schema:load`. When creating a new database, `bin/rails db:schema:load` tends to
    # be faster and is potentially less error prone than running all of your
    # migrations from scratch. Old migrations may fail to apply correctly if those
    # migrations use external dependencies or application code.
    #
    # It's strongly recommended that you check this file into your version control system.

    ActiveRecord::Schema[7.2].define(version: 2024_10_28_171235) do
      create_table "articles", force: :cascade do |t|
        t.string "title"
        t.text "body"
        t.datetime "created_at", null: false
        t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
        t.string "status"
      end

      create_table "comments", force: :cascade do |t|
        t.string "commenter"
        t.text "body"
        t.integer "article_id", null: false
        t.datetime "created_at", null: false
        t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
        t.string "status"
        t.index ["article_id"], name: "index_comments_on_article_id"
      end

      add_foreign_key "comments", "articles"
    end

    ```

    This is the ActiveRecord model you need to convert:
    **file**: app/models/comment.rb
    ```ruby
    class Comment < ApplicationRecord
      include Visible

      belongs_to :article
    end

    ```

    First, create `app/models/firestoreable.rb` base file that works with ActiveModel and make a fully compatible ActiveRecord-like class so I can replace the ActiveRecord inheritance with it. Remember to use `primary_abstract_class` to avoid creating a table for this class.

    The new class should be able to:
      - read the schema from the ActiveRecord model
      - create a Firestore collection with the same name as the ActiveRecord table
      - create Firestore documents for each record in the ActiveRecord table
      - read and write data to Firestore
      - handle associations
      - handle validations
      - handle callbacks
      - handle scopes
      - handle queries

    The class must be compatible to the extreme, so I can simple rename '< ApplicationRecord' to '< Firestoreable' and everything should work as before!

To create a fully compatible `Firestoreable` base class for replacing ActiveRecord models with Firestore, we'll need to implement several key functionalities. Below is an example of how you might start building this class.

### Step 1: Create the `app/models/firestoreable.rb` file

```ruby
require 'google/cloud/firestore'

module Firestoreable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    primary_abstract_class
    self.firestore_client = Google::Cloud::Firestore.new(project: ENV['GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID'], keyfile_path: ENV['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'])
    self.collection_name = table_name.to_s.singularize.pluralize
    self.instance_methods.each { |method| define_method(method) { delegate_missing_to :firestore_record } }
  end

  module ClassMethods
    def firestore_client=(client)
      @firestore_client = client
    end

    def collection_name=(name)
      @collection_name = name
    end

    def create(attributes = {})
      record = new(attributes)
      record.save!
      record
    end

    def find(id)
      doc_ref = firestore_client.doc(collection_name, id)
      if (doc = doc_ref.get).exists?
        new(doc.data.merge(id: doc.path.split('/')[-1]))
      else
        raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound.new("Couldn't find #{self.name} with 'id'=#{id}")
      end
    end

    def all
      firestore_client.collection(collection_name).documents.map { |doc| new(doc.data.merge(id: doc.path.split('/')[-1])) }
    end

    def where(query)
      # Implement Firestore query here
      # For simplicity, this example will only handle equality conditions
      if query.is_a?(Hash) && query.length == 1
        key, value = query.first
        firestore_client.collection(collection_name).where(key.to_s, '==', value).documents.map { |doc| new(doc.data.merge(id: doc.path.split('/')[-1])) }
      else
        raise NotImplementedError.new("Firestoreable only supports simple equality queries for now")
      end
    end

    def update_all(attributes)
      firestore_client.collection(collection_name).update do |batch|
        all.each do |record|
          batch.update(record.firestore_record.ref, attributes)
        end
      end
    end

    def destroy_all
      firestore_client.collection(collection_name).delete
    end
  end

  def initialize(attributes = {})
    @attributes = attributes.dup
    self.class.instance_methods(false).each { |method| define_method(method) { delegate_missing_to :attributes } }
  end

  def save!
    if id.nil?
      create_record
    else
      update_record
    end
  end

  def delete!
    firestore_record.ref.delete
  end

  private

  def delegate_missing_to(target)
    ->(method, *args, &block) { target.send(method, *args, &block) }
  end

  def create_record
    doc_ref = firestore_client.collection(collection_name).doc
    doc_ref.set(@attributes)
    self.id = doc_ref.path.split('/')[-1]
  end

  def update_record
    firestore_record.ref.update(@attributes)
  end

  def firestore_record
    @firestore_record ||= firestore_client.doc(collection_name, id)
  end
end
```

### Step 2: Create the Firestore model for `Comment`

```ruby
# app/firebase_models/comment.rb

class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Visible
  include Firestoreable

  belongs_to :article
end
```

### Explanation:

1. **Firestoreable Module**:
   - The module includes necessary functionality to interact with Firestore, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents.
   - It handles basic query operations like `find`, `all`, `where`, and updates.

2. **Class Methods**:
   - `create`: Creates a new record in Firestore.
   - `find`: Retrieves a document by its ID.
   - `all`: Fetches all documents from the Firestore collection.
   - `where`: Performs simple equality queries (only supports one condition for now).
   - `update_all`: Updates multiple records at once using batch updates.
   - `destroy_all`: Deletes all documents in the Firestore collection.

3. **Instance Methods**:
   - Initializes a new record with attributes.
   - Saves the record to Firestore.
   - Deletes the record from Firestore.

4. **Delegate Missing Method**:
   - Delegates any missing methods (like accessing attributes) to the `@attributes` hash or the Firestore document itself.

5. **Firestore Record Management**:
   - Manages the connection to the Firestore collection and individual documents.

### Usage:

To use this new Firestore model, simply replace your existing ActiveRecord models with these Firestore models in your application code. For example, you can now create a comment like so:

```ruby
comment = Comment.create(commenter: 'John Doe', body: 'This is a comment.', status: 'active')
```

### Important Notes:
- This example only handles basic operations and equality queries. For more complex scenarios (like associations, nested documents, advanced queries), additional work will be required.
- Error handling, validation, and callbacks need to be properly implemented to ensure robustness.
- Consider breaking down the `Firestoreable` module into smaller concerns for better maintainability.

This should give you a solid foundation to start converting your ActiveRecord models to Firestore in your Ruby on Rails application.
