    You are an expert Ruby on Rails developer.
    Your mission is to convert ActiveRecord models to work with Google Firestore instead of a relational databases.
    The ActiveRecord class along with the schema will act as a base configuration for the Firestore models.
    All new Firebase models will live in `app/firebase_models/` and will include a new concern that will map all its relational
    database activities to Firestore instead. You use 'google-cloud-firestore' gem to interact with Firestore. The user already has this gem installed and knows how to use it.
    We already use GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID and GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variables to connect to Firestore (No need to write code to manage those settings)

    The project's full db/schema.rb is:
    ```ruby
    # This file is auto-generated from the current state of the database. Instead
    # of editing this file, please use the migrations feature of Active Record to
    # incrementally modify your database, and then regenerate this schema definition.
    #
    # This file is the source Rails uses to define your schema when running `bin/rails
    # db:schema:load`. When creating a new database, `bin/rails db:schema:load` tends to
    # be faster and is potentially less error prone than running all of your
    # migrations from scratch. Old migrations may fail to apply correctly if those
    # migrations use external dependencies or application code.
    #
    # It's strongly recommended that you check this file into your version control system.

    ActiveRecord::Schema[7.2].define(version: 2024_10_28_171235) do
      create_table "articles", force: :cascade do |t|
        t.string "title"
        t.text "body"
        t.datetime "created_at", null: false
        t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
        t.string "status"
      end

      create_table "comments", force: :cascade do |t|
        t.string "commenter"
        t.text "body"
        t.integer "article_id", null: false
        t.datetime "created_at", null: false
        t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
        t.string "status"
        t.index ["article_id"], name: "index_comments_on_article_id"
      end

      add_foreign_key "comments", "articles"
    end

    ```
  "role": |-

    This is the ActiveRecord model you need to convert:
    **file**: app/models/comment.rb
    ```ruby
    class Comment < ApplicationRecord
      include Visible

      belongs_to :article
    end

    ```

    Think out load all the complexities of using Firebase instead of Postgres and how you plan to solve them.
    How will you handle:
      - associations
      - validations
      - callbacks
      - scopes
      - queries

    Create `app/models/firestoreable.rb` base file that works with ActiveModel and make a fully compatible ActiveRecord-like class
    so I can replace the ActiveRecord inheritance with it.
    Remember to use `primary_abstract_class` to avoid creating a table for this class.

### Firestore Model and Concerns:

To convert your ActiveRecord model to work with Google Firestore, you'll need to create a new base file called `app/models/firestoreable.rb`. This file will inherit from `ActiveModel::Model`, which is suitable for models that don't require database persistence but still need validations or callbacks.

### Handling Associations and Foreign Keys:

Firestore does not support foreign keys like traditional relational databases. Instead, you'll need to handle associations manually by storing the IDs of related documents directly in the Firestore document.

Hereâ€™s how you can convert your `Comment` model to use Firestore:

1. **Create a Firestore Model:**

   ```ruby
   # app/firebase_models/comment.rb
   class Firebase::Comment < ActiveModel::Model
     include Visible

     attr_accessor :id, :article_id, :commenter, :body, :created_at, :updated_at, :status

     validates :article_id, presence: true
     validates :commenter, presence: true
     validates :body, presence: true

     before_validation :set_timestamps, on: :create
     after_save :sync_article_comments

     def save
       if valid?
         @id ||= Firestore::Comment.collection.doc.id
         Firestore::Comment.collection.doc(@id).set(self.attributes)
         true
       else
         false
       end
     end

     def self.find(id)
       doc = Firestore::Comment.collection.doc(id).get
       new(doc.data.merge(id: doc.document_id))
     end

     private

     def set_timestamps
       self.created_at ||= Time.current
       self.updated_at ||= Time.current
     end

     def sync_article_comments
       article = Firebase::Article.find(self.article_id)
       article.comments_count += 1 if self.status == 'visible'
       article.save
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Create a Concern to Handle Firestoreable Models:**

   ```ruby
   # app/models/concerns/firestoreable.rb
   module Firestoreable
     extend ActiveSupport::Concern

     included do
       primary_abstract_class
     end

     def self.create(attributes = {})
       model = new(attributes)
       model.save
       model
     end

     def save
       raise NotImplementedError, "You need to implement the save method in your subclass"
     end

     def self.find(id)
       raise NotImplementedError, "You need to implement the find method in your subclass"
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Update the Comment Model to Use Firestoreable Concern:**

   ```ruby
   # app/models/comment.rb
   class Comment < ApplicationRecord
     include Visible
     include Firestoreable

     attr_accessor :id, :article_id, :commenter, :body, :created_at, :updated_at, :status

     validates :article_id, presence: true
     validates :commenter, presence: true
     validates :body, presence: true

     before_validation :set_timestamps, on: :create
     after_save :sync_article_comments

     def save
       if valid?
         @id ||= Firestore::Comment.collection.doc.id
         Firestore::Comment.collection.doc(@id).set(self.attributes)
         true
       else
         false
       end
     end

     def self.find(id)
       doc = Firestore::Comment.collection.doc(id).get
       new(doc.data.merge(id: doc.document_id))
     end

     private

     def set_timestamps
       self.created_at ||= Time.current
       self.updated_at ||= Time.current
     end

     def sync_article_comments
       article = Firebase::Article.find(self.article_id)
       article.comments_count += 1 if self.status == 'visible'
       article.save
     end
   end
   ```

### Handling Associations and Foreign Keys:

To handle associations, you can store the IDs of related documents directly in Firestore. For example, if a `Comment` belongs to an `Article`, you would store the `article_id` in the Firestore document for that comment.

### Querying Firestore Documents:

Querying Firestore documents is straightforward using the Firestore API provided by the `google-cloud-firestore` gem. You can chain query methods like `where`, `order_by`, and `limit` to retrieve specific documents.

### Validations and Callbacks:

Validations and callbacks in Firestore models are handled similarly to ActiveRecord. You can use built-in validations or custom callbacks just as you would in an ActiveRecord model.

### Scopes:

Scopes in Firestore can be implemented using the chainable methods provided by Firestore. For example, if you want a scope for visible comments, you can define it like this:

```ruby
def self.visible
  where(status: 'visible')
end
```

Then you can use this scope to retrieve only visible comments.

### Conclusion:

By following these steps, you can convert your ActiveRecord models to Firestore models while maintaining the same interface and functionality. The `Firestoreable` concern provides a common base for all Firestore models, making it easier to implement associations, validations, callbacks, scopes, and queries.
