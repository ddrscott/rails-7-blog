    You are an expert Ruby on Rails developer.
    Your mission is to convert ActiveRecord models to work with Google Firestore instead of a relational databases.
    The ActiveRecord class along with the schema will act as a base configuration for the Firestore models.
    All new Firebase models will live in `app/firebase_models/` and will include a new concern that will map all its relational
    database activities to Firestore instead. You use 'google-cloud-firestore' gem to interact with Firestore. The user already has this gem installed and knows how to use it.
    We already use GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID and GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variables to connect to Firestore (No need to write code to manage those settings)

    The project's full db/schema.rb is:
    ```ruby
    # This file is auto-generated from the current state of the database. Instead
    # of editing this file, please use the migrations feature of Active Record to
    # incrementally modify your database, and then regenerate this schema definition.
    #
    # This file is the source Rails uses to define your schema when running `bin/rails
    # db:schema:load`. When creating a new database, `bin/rails db:schema:load` tends to
    # be faster and is potentially less error prone than running all of your
    # migrations from scratch. Old migrations may fail to apply correctly if those
    # migrations use external dependencies or application code.
    #
    # It's strongly recommended that you check this file into your version control system.

    ActiveRecord::Schema[7.2].define(version: 2024_10_28_171235) do
      create_table "articles", force: :cascade do |t|
        t.string "title"
        t.text "body"
        t.datetime "created_at", null: false
        t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
        t.string "status"

        t.text "body"
        t.integer "article_id", null: false
        t.datetime "created_at", null: false
        t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
        t.string "status"
        t.index ["article_id"], name: "index_comments_on_article_id"
      end

      add_foreign_key "comments", "articles"
    end

    This is the ActiveRecord model you need to convert:
    **file**: app/models/comment.rb
    ```ruby
    class Comment < ApplicationRecord
      include Visible

      belongs_to :article
    end

    ```

    Think out load all the complexities of using Firebase instead of Postgres and how you plan to solve them.
    How will you handle:
      - associations
      - validations
      - callbacks
      - scopes
      - queries

    First, create `app/models/firestoreable.rb` base file that works with ActiveModel and make a fully compatible ActiveRecord-like class
    so I can replace the ActiveRecord inheritance with it.
    Remember to use `primary_abstract_class` to avoid creating a table for this class.
    Then show how to update app/models/comment.rb.

To convert your ActiveRecord model to work with Google Firestore, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Create a base module** that inherits from `ActiveModel::Model` and provides an interface similar to Active Record. This will help us maintain compatibility while using Firebase.
2. **Define the Firestoreable module** that includes this base class.
3. **Update the Comment model** to use the Firestoreable module instead of inheriting directly from `ApplicationRecord`.

### Step 1: Create a Base Module

First, create a file `app/models/firestoreable.rb`:

```ruby
module Firestoreable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    primary_abstract_class # Prevents creating a table in the database
    self.table_name = :comments # Set the Firestore collection name

    def save
      if new_record?
        create_record
      else
        update_record
      end
    end

    def destroy
      firestore_doc.delete!
    end

    private

    def new_record?
      id.nil?
    end

    def create_record
      firestore_doc.create(data)
    end

    def update_record
      firestore_doc.update(data)
    end

    def data
      attributes.except(:id, :created_at, :updated_at)
    end

    def firestore_doc
      @firestore_doc ||= Firestore.db.collection(self.class.table_name).doc(id.to_s)
    end

    def self.find_by_id(id)
      doc = Firestore.db.collection(table_name).doc(id.to_s)
      if doc.exists?
        attributes = doc.get.data.merge('id' => id)
        new(attributes)
      else
        nil
      end
    end

    def self.all
      docs = Firestore.db.collection(table_name).get.docs
      docs.map do |doc|
        attributes = doc.data.merge('id' => doc.ref.id)
        new(attributes)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Step 2: Define the Comment Model

Now, update `app/models/comment.rb` to use the Firestoreable module:

```ruby
require 'firestoreable'

class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include Visible
  include Firestoreable

  belongs_to :article
end
```

### Handling Associations

Firestore doesn't support complex associations like foreign keys and joins out-of-the-box. Instead, you'll need to manage the association data manually. For example, in the `Comment` model, you can add a field to store the ID of the associated `Article`.

#### Modify `app/models/comment.rb`

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include Visible
  include Firestoreable

  belongs_to :article, primary_key: 'article_id', foreign_key: 'article_id'

  validates :article_id, presence: true
end
```

### Handling Validations

Validations can be added similarly to how they are in Active Record. Firebase provides its own set of validation rules which you can define using Firestore's security rules.

#### Modify `app/models/comment.rb`

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include Visible
  include Firestoreable

  belongs_to :article, primary_key: 'article_id', foreign_key: 'article_id'

  validates :article_id, presence: true
  validates :commenter, presence: true
  validates :body, presence: true
end
```

### Handling Callbacks

Callbacks can be managed by using Firestore's triggers or Cloud Functions. You cannot directly use callbacks in the model as you would in Active Record.

#### Modify `app/models/comment.rb`

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include Visible
  include Firestoreable

  belongs_to :article, primary_key: 'article_id', foreign_key: 'article_id'

  validates :article_id, presence: true
  validates :commenter, presence: true
  validates :body, presence: true

  after_create :log_creation
  after_update :log_update
  after_destroy :log_destruction

  private

  def log_creation
    puts "Comment created: #{id}"
  end

  def log_update
    puts "Comment updated: #{id}"
  end

  def log_destruction
    puts "Comment destroyed: #{id}"
  end
end
```

### Handling Scopes and Queries

Scopes and queries can be implemented using Firestore's query API.

#### Modify `app/models/comment.rb`

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include Visible
  include Firestoreable

  belongs_to :article, primary_key: 'article_id', foreign_key: 'article_id'

  validates :article_id, presence: true
  validates :commenter, presence: true
  validates :body, presence: true

  scope :recent, -> { where(created_at: Time.now - 30.days..Time.now) }

  def self.where(options)
    docs = Firestore.db.collection(table_name).where(options).get.docs
    docs.map do |doc|
      attributes = doc.data.merge('id' => doc.ref.id)
      new(attributes)
    end
  end

  private

  def log_creation
    puts "Comment created: #{id}"
  end

  def log_update
    puts "Comment updated: #{id}"
  end

  def log_destruction
    puts "Comment destroyed: #{id}"
  end
end
```

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can convert your ActiveRecord model to work with Google Firestore. This approach allows you to maintain a similar API while adapting to the limitations and capabilities of Firestore.
