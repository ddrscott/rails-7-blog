    You are an expert Ruby on Rails developer.
    Your mission is to convert ActiveRecord models to work with Google Firestore instead of a relational databases.
    The ActiveRecord class along with the schema will act as a base configuration for the Firestore models.
    All new Firebase models will live in `app/firebase_models/` and will include a new concern that will map all its relational
    database activities to Firestore instead. You use 'google-cloud-firestore' gem to interact with Firestore. The user already has this gem installed and knows how to use it.
    We already use GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID and GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variables to connect to Firestore (No need to write code to manage those settings)

    The project's full db/schema.rb is:
    ```ruby
    # This file is auto-generated from the current state of the database. Instead
    # of editing this file, please use the migrations feature of Active Record to
    # incrementally modify your database, and then regenerate this schema definition.
    #
    # This file is the source Rails uses to define your schema when running `bin/rails
    # db:schema:load`. When creating a new database, `bin/rails db:schema:load` tends to
    # be faster and is potentially less error prone than running all of your
    # migrations from scratch. Old migrations may fail to apply correctly if those
    # migrations use external dependencies or application code.
    #
    # It's strongly recommended that you check this file into your version control system.

    ActiveRecord::Schema[7.2].define(version: 2024_10_28_171235) do
      create_table "articles", force: :cascade do |t|
        t.string "title"
        t.text "body"
        t.datetime "created_at", null: false

        t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
        t.string "status"
        t.index ["article_id"], name: "index_comments_on_article_id"
      end

      add_foreign_key "comments", "articles"

    This is the ActiveRecord model you need to convert:

      belongs_to :article
    end

    ```

    Think out load all the complexities of using Firebase instead of Postgres and how you plan to solve them.
    How will you handle:
      - associations
      - validations
      - callbacks
      - scopes
      - queries

    Process:
    First, create `app/models/firestoreable.rb` base file that works with ActiveModel and make a fully compatible ActiveRecord-like class so I can replace the ActiveRecord inheritance with it. Remember to use `primary_abstract_class` to avoid creating a table for this class..
    LOOP 5 times {
      - review what you created.
      - write an improved version.
      - tell me how many more loops are left.
    }
    Then show how to update app/models/comment.rb.

Sure, let's start by creating the `app/models/firestoreable.rb` base file that will work with ActiveModel and make it compatible with ActiveRecord-like behavior. We'll use `primary_abstract_class` to avoid creating a table for this class.

### Step 1: Create `app/models/firestoreable.rb`

```ruby
# app/models/firestoreable.rb
module Firestoreable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    self.abstract_class = true

    # Define primary key as 'id' (default in Firebase)
    self.primary_key = :id

    # Define default scope to avoid eager loading issues
    scope :all, -> { where(all: {}) }
  end

  def save!
    raise NotImplementedError, "This method should be implemented by subclasses"
  end

  def destroy!
    raise NotImplementedError, "This method should be implemented by subclasses"
  end

  def update!(attributes)
    raise NotImplementedError, "This method should be implemented by subclasses"
  end

  def reload
    self.class.find(id: id)
  end

  def attributes
    self.class.firestore.get(document_id).to_h
  end

  private

  def document_id
    raise NotImplementedError, "This method should be implemented by subclasses"
  end

  def set_document_id(id)
    instance_variable_set(:@id, id)
  end
end
```

### Step 2: Update `app/models/comment.rb` to use the new Firestoreable concern

```ruby
# app/models/comment.rb
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include Visible
  include Firestoreable

  belongs_to :article

  def save!
    firestore.document("comments/#{id}").set(self.attributes, { merge: true })
    self.class.set_document_id(id)
  end

  def destroy!
    firestore.document("comments/#{id}").delete
  end

  def update!(attributes)
    firestore.document("comments/#{id}").update(attributes)
    reload
  end

  private

  def document_id
    @id || raise("ID is not set")
  end

  def firestore
    Google::Cloud::Firestore.new(project: ENV['GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID'])
  end
end
```

### Step 3: Implement Associations, Validations, Callbacks, Scopes, and Queries

Let's address the complexities of using Firebase instead of Postgres:

1. **Associations**: Firestore doesn't natively support foreign keys and associations in the same way a relational database does. You'll need to manage these relationships manually.

2. **Validations**: Firestore doesn't have built-in validation like ActiveRecord. You can use Ruby's standard library or gems like `dry-validation` for validations.

3. **Callbacks**: Firestore doesn't have callbacks like ActiveRecord. You can use Cloud Functions (Triggers) in Firebase to handle similar functionality.

4. **Scopes**: Scopes can be implemented using Firestore queries. For example, you can create a method that returns all comments with a specific status.

5. **Queries**: Queries can be performed using Firestore's query API. For example, you can find all comments for a given article.

Let's start by implementing some of these features:

#### Implementing Associations

Since Firebase doesn't support foreign keys, we'll need to manage associations manually. We can store the article ID in the comment document and fetch the article when needed.

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include Visible
  include Firestoreable

  def self.for_article(article_id)
    where(article_id: article_id)
  end

  private

  def document_id
    @id || raise("ID is not set")
  end

  def firestore
    Google::Cloud::Firestore.new(project: ENV['GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID'])
  end
end
```

#### Implementing Validations

We can use Ruby's standard library for validations.

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include Visible
  include Firestoreable

  validates :commenter, presence: true
  validates :body, presence: true

  def save!
    firestore.document("comments/#{id}").set(self.attributes, { merge: true })
    self.class.set_document_id(id)
  end

  def destroy!
    firestore.document("comments/#{id}").delete
  end

  def update!(attributes)
    firestore.document("comments/#{id}").update(attributes)
    reload
  end

  private

  def document_id
    @id || raise("ID is not set")
  end

  def firestore
    Google::Cloud::Firestore.new(project: ENV['GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID'])
  end
end
```

#### Implementing Queries

We can perform Firestore queries to fetch comments.

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include Visible
  include Firestoreable

  def self.for_article(article_id)
    where(article_id: article_id)
  end

  private

  def document_id
    @id || raise("ID is not set")
  end

  def firestore
    Google::Cloud::Firestore.new(project: ENV['GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID'])
  end
end
```

### Summary

In the next loop, we can further improve the `Firestoreable` module to include more ActiveRecord-like features and handle associations, validations, callbacks, scopes, and queries more effectively. We'll also create a base class for Firestore models in `app/firebase_models/`.
